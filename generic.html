									<h3>Growing Up</h3>
									<p>Born: Allentown, PA circa 1994</p>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/ypt.png" alt="" /></span>Hailing from Eastern Pennsylvania, Philly sport teams are a passion of mine (Philly Philly = greatest play, DON'T @ ME!)
									and while Football was my favorite, I excelled in playing soccer (Futbol!). In my youth, I played at the highest competitive Level
									with clubs like Spirit United (Downingtown, PA), PA Classics (Lancaster, PA -- shout out to Christian Pullisic!), and eventually for ODP (Olympic Development Progam).
									Nominated as Captain for most clubs, I played with current soccer stars like Russell Canouse (DC United), Zack Steffen (Manchester City), and many
									more. 
									<blockquote>Photo Cred: https://www.yptusa.com/rp06photos.html</blockquote> 
									Eventually I was "noticed" by youth trainers from AC Milan, Manchester United, BSC Young Boys, etc. during a week-long YPT program held in
									Middletown, DE. I was asked to "try out" in their respective countries to see if I could join their youth development team staying at world-class 
									facilities. My dream had come true! But a few months after the initial invitation to try out, I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes, which ultimately
									ended any talks. Little did I know, the feeling of dream-devestating news would become a motivation towards new passions.<br /><br />

									My new passion became learning - education on various subjects: cultural, philosophical, and now computational. Motivation requires a spark, even when 
									setbacks occur - c'est la vie - but I've learned something that Rocky (yes, Philly things will always be with me) once said:
									<blockquote>“Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It's a very mean and nasty place and 
										I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. 
										But it ain't about how hard ya hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. 
										That's how winning is done! Now, if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth. 
										But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody.” 
										― Sylvester Stallone, Rocky Balboa.</blockquote></p>

									<h3>College</h3>
									<p>West Virginia Univsity: Global Supply Chain Management (2013 - 2017)</p>
								</header>
								<p>Moving out of my comfort zone in PA, I studied Global Supply Chain Management at WVU where I didn't know a single person. Unlike others, I enjoy
									putting myself in positions that I'm unfamiliar with because I believe that is when you learn the most about yourself. I quickly joined clubs like 
									Student Government Association and later joined Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Constantly meeting new faces allowed me to develop better 
									interpersonal skills, greater confidence in introductions, and emotional intelligence from a more diverse landscape. <br /><br />
									As for education, I have always been interested in the planning of logistics and the modes of transportation. The degree pursued gave me better 
									understanding into the global network of distribution. One of my favorite classes involved simulating supply chains to assess where weak points 
									were located, which partly inspired me to later go on to pursue a more analytical degree.

									<h3>Grad School</h3>
									<p>Lewis University: Data Science concentration Computer Science (2020 - 2022)</p>
								</header>
								<p>The decision to apply for an MSDS degree was led by a few realizations: first, world problems in logistics can only be solved with technology 
									due to the level of complexity involved in lead-time demand, safety stock levels, and supply/demand curves. Second, I became introduced to 
									concepts like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. </p>

									<h3>Work Experience</h3>
									<p>Elite Transit Solutions, LLC: Logistics Manager (2017 - 2020)<br />
										Bank of New York Mellon: Logistics Manager (2022 - Current)
									</p>
								</header>
								<p>After graduating on a Saturday, I set off to work for Elite Transit Solutions, LLC the Monday after - I'm typically not one to wait for the 
									next chapter to start, but rather eager to tackle any challenge ahead of me. <br />
									Like anyone else, I started at the lowest rung of the company, but due to extreme dedication quickly moved up the ladder. At the time of joining,
									the ELITE had about 15 employees grossing around 10-20 million dollars as a 3rd party logistics provider. <br /><br />
									I later joined my current employer, Bank of New York Mellon, under the Portfolio Services department. Due to organizational restructuring, employee
									turnover, and an explosion in US Voluntary stock exchanges, the team spent long days of overtime. I set out a plan to automate financial documents. 
									I learned that half of the data remained unchanged from Offer to Offer with half being variable information obtained from another database. It became
									clear that reading the variable information row-by-row and inserting into the hardcoded data would acheive completion for the tasks at hand. As a result, 
									I created a mesh table that combined both aspects.<br /><br />
									The programs were written in VBA and Python. The result of the programs decreased the task by 90% - that is, it took 10% of the time to complete as compared 
									to the most experienced colleagues (defined by 10+ years) doing the same by traditional means. I created programs to automate textual documents from DTCC 
									(The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation) by utilizing regular expressions. This returned a 95% decrease in formatting the textual documents, in which the 
									average document contained 5+ pages, or around 3,000 words.<br /><br />
									These programs opened up more time for me to help out others in different departments, which gave me free education into more financial offerings. I also became 
									the go-to guy for any (and basically all) tech-related issues. Reach out to Tara Weiland or Lisa Falsetti if you'd like to learn more about my impact.
